Two simple options:

A — Recommended (edit plain file):

Open interview_prep/sample_script.txt in any text editor.

Replace all content with your new script (no Python editing needed).

Save.

Run python tts_prep.py. The script reads sample_script.txt first and uses that text for audio.

B — Inline replacement (edit Python):

Open interview_prep/tts_prep.py.

Find the block:

audio_script = """
Welcome to the Eric Wilson Token Life Cycle — ETH Edition.
...
"""


Replace the entire triple-quoted """ ... """ content with your new text (keep triple quotes).

Save and run python tts_prep.py.

Extra tips:

Keep each paragraph separated by blank lines for natural pauses.

Control speed: engine.setProperty('rate', 140) slower, 170 faster.

Switch voice: engine.setProperty('voice', voices[1].id) for different voice.

If audio is too long, break into multiple files (chunk sample_script.txt into parts, then run multiple times).
